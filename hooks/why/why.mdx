# Why are hooks better?

<List>
  <Appear>
    <ListItem>They allow you to co-locate all logic relating to a specific feature. No more splitting it between multiple lifecycle methods or duplicating logic.</ListItem>
    <ListItem>Simpler, cleaner, and more easily sharable. Creating <em>custom hooks</em> is just a matter of moving your code to a new function.</ListItem>
    <ListItem>Get the benefits of higher order components but with simple functions and without clogging up your React tree.</ListItem>
