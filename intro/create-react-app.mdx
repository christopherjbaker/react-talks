## Philosophy

<List>
  <Appear>
    <ListItem><strong>One Dependency</strong>: provides a cohesive curated experience<br /><br /></ListItem>
    <ListItem><strong>No Configuration Required</strong>: so you can focus on writing code<br /><br /></ListItem>
    <ListItem><strong>No Lock-In</strong>: you can “eject” to a custom setup at any time</ListItem>
  </Appear>
</List>

```notes
* One Dependency: There is just one build dependency. It uses Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.
* No Configuration Required: You don't need to configure anything. Reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.
* No Lock-In: You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.
```

## Ejecting

This will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.

```notes
You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature.
```
