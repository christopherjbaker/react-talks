# Introduction to React

---

## the react way

* Abstraction for the DOM
  * Keep it that way.
  * Will discuss how and when to step into DOM in advanced talk.
* “Everything is a component”
* Many small components. Single responsibility.
* Composition is key

---

## jsx

* jsx is not html (few minor differences: className, htmlFor, etc)
* don't underestimate nice looking, simple JSX.
* a bit about props

---

## Components and Render functions

* As before, “Everything is a component”
* Don’t be afraid to create many small components to increase legibility, maintainability, and separation of concerns
* make more components to get nice JSX. seriously. Do it.
  * Non-exported render-only functions are A-OK
    * (though I often like to put them in their own file if there’s more than a few)
* PropTypes
  * Create a contract for the data into your component. Be as specific as possible (ie: don’t use PropTypes.object or PropTypes.any unless that is the best you can do)
  * Usually just need simple: string, number, etc
  * Can (and should) go deeper with shape
  * Can (and often should) get complex with arrayOf, objectOf
* Show examples with single component vs multiple
  * Navigation List with classNames on nav, ul, li, a
    * Break out li, a
    * Break out nav, ul also, for semantics even though not re-used
    * Now you have a navigation component library that can be shared!

---

## DDAU. no two-way binding

* Provide props and update functions. Call update functions from event handlers
* Mention function binding caching issues
* Simple pagination example?

---

## Forms

* Controlled vs Uncontrolled
  * Controlled is usually correct
* Contact form example, using DDAU (name, email, message and onChange)

---

## how rendering works

* render function re-run
  * When props change. Is there anything to say here?
* react handles diffing + dom updates
  * Is there anything to say here, other than that it happens?
* Lifecycle
  * Make/find a diagram
  * (hide advanced like getDerivedStateFromProps an getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()?)
  * Mount:
    * constructor()
    * static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    * render()
    * componentDidMount()
  * Update
    * static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    * shouldComponentUpdate()
    * render()
    * getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
    * componentDidUpdate()
  * Unmount
    * componentWillUnmount()

---

## setState (don't mutate)

* State is inevitable
* Several popular solutions (future talks), but also a native solution: setState
  * Even when using others, I still use setState for simple view state, like panel visibility and current form state
* Simple panel visibility example
* Contact example from earlier, but with state
  * External state
  * Internal state: change onChange to onSubmit
    * is now uncontrolled
    * Can use key prop to reset

---

## create-react-app

* the de-facto starter for the react community (there are others, but most use this)
* npx create-react-app my-app
  * screenshot with mention of upcoming workshop
* react-scripts
* the starter page
* the goodies (code-splitting, service workers, PWAs, deployment, etc...)
  * Probably not much detail here. List and where to find in docs?
* Ejecting
  * When to eject and when to not eject?
