## setState (don't mutate)

* State is inevitable
* Several popular solutions (future talks), but also a native solution: setState
  * Even when using others, I still use setState for simple view state, like panel visibility and current form state
* Simple panel visibility example
* Contact example from earlier, but with state
  * External state
  * Internal state: change onChange to onSubmit
    * is now uncontrolled
    * Can use key prop to reset
