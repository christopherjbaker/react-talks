## Components and Render functions

* As before, “Everything is a component”
* Don’t be afraid to create many small components to increase legibility, maintainability, and separation of concerns
* make more components to get nice JSX. seriously. Do it.
  * Non-exported render-only functions are A-OK
    * (though I often like to put them in their own file if there’s more than a few)
* PropTypes
  * Create a contract for the data into your component. Be as specific as possible (ie: don’t use PropTypes.object or PropTypes.any unless that is the best you can do)
  * Usually just need simple: string, number, etc
  * Can (and should) go deeper with shape
  * Can (and often should) get complex with arrayOf, objectOf
* Show examples with single component vs multiple
  * Navigation List with classNames on nav, ul, li, a
    * Break out li, a
    * Break out nav, ul also, for semantics even though not re-used
    * Now you have a navigation component library that can be shared!
