```notes
In React, inline styles are not specified as a string. Instead they are specified with an object whose key is the camelCased version of the style name, and whose value is the style's value, usually a string.

Style keys are camelCased in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes from JS (e.g. node.style.backgroundImage).
